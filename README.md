Programs taking two different approaches to choosing which damper to put on an air-craft given certain parameters. Amplitude.ipynb rearranges the equation to solve for the amplitude given a certain dampening value while DifferentialEquationsVisualizer.ipynb just displays the actual plots and calculates the amplitude more qualitatively.
